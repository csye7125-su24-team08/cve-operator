# CVE Operator

The CVE Operator is a Kubernetes operator that creates a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for `GithubReleaseMonitor` and `GithubRelease`. It also creates a job to process the deltas obtained from the CVE releases.

## Installation

To install the CVE Operator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cve-operator.git
```

2. Apply the CRD:

```shell
kubectl apply -f cve-operator/crd.yaml
```

3. Deploy the operator:

```shell
kubectl apply -f cve-operator/operator.yaml
```

4. Verify the installation:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n cve-operator-system
```

## Usage

Once the CVE Operator is installed, you can start using it to monitor CVE releases and process the deltas. Here's an example of how to create a `GithubReleaseMonitor`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cveoperator.example.com/v1alpha1
kind: GithubReleaseMonitor
metadata:
  name: my-release-monitor
spec:
  repository: your-username/your-repo
  interval: 1h
```

This will create a monitor that checks for new releases in the specified GitHub repository every hour.

To create a job that processes the deltas, you can use the `GithubRelease` resource. Here's an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: cveoperator.example.com/v1alpha1
kind: GithubRelease
metadata:
  name: my-release
spec:
  repository: your-username/your-repo
  version: v1.0.0
```

This will create a job that processes the deltas between the specified version and the latest release in the repository.
